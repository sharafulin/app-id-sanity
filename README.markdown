# App ID Sanity

App IDs are "[the herpes of iPhone provisioning][so-herpes]". Once you've created one, you're
stuck with it for life. You can't edit it or delete it. By the time I realised this, I had way
more than I needed.

**App ID Sanity** is the cure! It's a simple browser extension that adds the ability to:

  * Rename an App ID
  * Mark an App ID as inactive (hides it from the App ID drop-down when creating a provisioning profile)

App ID Sanity works in Safari and Google Chrome.

## Safari

[Install Now][safari-latest] 

(Downloads the compiled extension from Amazon S3)

## Google Chrome

Install from the [Chrome Web Store][chrome-webstore].
